# Evolution-Strategy-ES-method-for-policy-search
Implemented and tuned the ES algorithm to learn efficient policies to control the cart in the Cartpole domain

The fine tuning of hyperparamters was done by varying α(learning rate), σ(exploration parameter), M (order of Fourier basis), N (number of episodes) and nPerturbations (number of perturbations).
